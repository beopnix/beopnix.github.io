              <p>
                 <span>In 1967, the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) Mexicali Campus, only had careers such as: Sociology, Pedagogy and Accounting. At that time there was no Engineering School, which was very necessary for Baja California. The accelerated growth of the city, the industry and agriculture of the Mexicali Valley required a large number of engineers to cover various areas for the entity´s development.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                 <span>If someone wanted to study engineering, they had to travel to Mexico City, Guadalajara, Hermosillo or Monterrey. The young “cachanillas” students, who wanted to be admitted to the UNAM, Polytechnic, Guadalajara University, Unison, Monterrey Institute of Technology, etc., engineering careers, encountered a problem: they were not allowed or had a difficulty being admitted, due to the fact that in Mexicali there already existed a university, even though this university did not have these careers they still were not admitted, therefore they had to enroll to private schools in those cities.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                 <span>In 1967 University authorities and a group of engineers, mostly civilians; together with other professionals were commissioned to study the state needs in educational matters, especially for this branch of science. Its conclusions in the end were: Engineering school needed to be established given the reasons found, creating it within the legal UABC framework.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                 <span>Once it was created with Mr. Rafael Soto Gil being the chancellor of UABC at the time, he selected Luís I. López Moctezuma Torres as its principal. Motivated by Engineer López Moctezuma, these professionals made the Engineering school project come true, giving rise to the career of Surveyor Engineer and Geodest. Duties began with an enrollment of nineteen students and a staff of eight teachers, being the following:</span>

              <p>
                 <span>Due to problems with high school students on September 17, 1968, Engineering school was installed in a building on Avenida Colón, best known as the ¨stables¨, it was an improvised building which lacked functionality, nevertheless, it was the first Engineering school´s own building. On October 14, 1968, at that place the second academic cycle of the Surveyor and Geodest Engineering career started.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>In 1968, engineer Luis I. López Moctezuma was appointed as permanent principal of Engineering school, and Engineer Gabriel Navarro Cuevas as the assistant principal. The selection was made from a group of the engineers: Luis López Moctezuma, Jorge Padilla Villanueva and the architect Marco Aurelio Sandoval, while Rafael Soto Gil was still UABC chancellor.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>Then, our principal founder Luis I. López Moctezuma was appointed as the Autonomous University of Baja California Chancellor, who upon assuming his new position designates engineer Isaias Romano Pérez as Provisional Engineering school Principal on November 25, 1971.                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                 <span>Engineering school, as mentioned, was born at the UABC in October 1967 as a consequence of the first stage of the university development´s planning studies that were launched by the chancellor´s office and carried out by professionals, researchers, teachers, students and council of the UABC itself; in accordance to the Planning Center of the National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education (by its acronym in Spanish: ANUIES), which indicated the guidelines to the opening of new careers, schools and research institutes.</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>These efforts, that culminated from 1968 to 1971 with the constitution of the Agricultural Sciences, Architecture, Tourism, Accounting and Medicine schools in Mexicali, revealed to us that it was crucial to start a new chapter in university development by establishing Schools in which the acquired knowledge and techniques would allow to apply the scientific knowledge and matter use, and the energy sources.</span>

                 <span>On May 2, 1972, the new facilities built on the University´s property on calzada Benito Juárez were inaugurated; and the location of the Engineering school was changed to the north building, the second floor was shared with the school of Architecture, first floor was occupied by the Accounting School and also by the University Library. In this building Mechanical Electrical Engineer career began on September 1972, with an initial enrollment of 64 students.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>The University´s growth made it necessary to change our school to the semi-finished buildings which were meant to be laboratories and workshops for the same school. On October 11th 1975, Engineering school was moved there, they remained there until the university complex was completed in February 1977. During those years floors 3 and 4 were shared with the school of Architecture, and 1st and 2nd floor were for engineering.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>In July 1977 the First Generation of Mechanical Electrical Engineers graduated, which was supported by Guillermo Montes Jiménez and was made up of 22 graduates in the electrical area, 12 in the mechanical area and 2 in the electronics area.</span>

                 <span>In 1986 the school of Architecture acquires its own building leaving the entire building for the Engineering school. As more careers were opened enrollment increases and there was a need to expand facilities, therefore, the university builds classrooms in a building which was shared by Accounting, Architecture and other schools.</span>

              <p>
                 <span>The Languages Center which shared workshops and laboratories with the Engineering school, is moved to its own building; leaving all the room to the current School, which is adapted to the needs of that time.</span>

                 <span>From 1993 to 1995, the study plans were restructured in all majors changing from what was called the Rigid Plan to the Flexible Plan. The Laboratories equipment remains and computers were acquired for different careers coordinators. The first three "International Engineering Symposiums" were held with the participation of some of the school's careers. In 1997 the Industrial Engineering career was opened and the Telecommunications Specialty was reopened. The transition from School to Faculty was made when the Master's Degree in Electronic Engineering and later the Master's Degree in Industrial Processes were created, also achieving the connection with the world information network (internet).</span>

              <p>
                 <span>Postgraduate studies appeared and the need of more space increases, currently having these postgraduate studies in telecommunications and masters and doctorates degrees in a program called MyDCI (Master's and Doctorate´s Degree in Sciences and Engineering by its Spanish Acronym). In 2000 the Master´s in Industrial Processes was opened, as well as, the Master´s and Doctorate´s Degree in Sciences and Engineering (MyDCI) in 2003. Currently this program is recognized as a quality program by the National Council of Science and Technology (by its acronym in Spanish: CONACYT).</span>

              <p>
                 <span>Given the need for the School of Engineering to have accredited laboratories and certified careers, ISO 9001:2000 certification works began on five laboratories which belonged to the Mechanical, Civil, Electronic, Topography and Computer engineering careers; achieving this certification in September 2003. After two years of continuous effort of teachers and laboratory assistants. The same year, study plans for all the careers were also restructured and designed by skill sets.</span>

               <p>
                 <span>Along with the certification work, in 2002 the process for the accreditation before CACEI of the Educational Programs (by its acronym in Spanish PE) offered by the school began; during the mentioned process all the teachers and each of the PEs actively participate. Subsequently, after two years of hard and efficient work, the final document arrived and they got a satisfactory agreement with all the guidelines established by the accreditation Institutions. School of Engineering received their Certificate of Accreditation in February 2004.</span>

                 <span>Since the 2004-2 school period, the organization of the School of Engineering is as follows: all students entering into School of Engineering need to go through the Basic Core, where there are 15 compulsory subjects that can be taken in the minimum of three or four semesters. Then apply for admission to what will be his field, which can be: Civil Engineer, Industrial Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Electronic Engineer, Computer Engineering, Mechatronics Engineer, Aerospace Engineering, Renewable Energy Engineering, and finally Bioengineering. On the other hand, the Bachelor of Computer Systems program is offered and does not share the Basic Core with the rest of the careers, because its basic subjects are different from the rest of the educational programs. All students get a tutor who guides and leads them in the Basic Core stage and a new one who attends to them in the specialty.</span>

               <p>
                 <span>By 2016, the educational programs of Aerospace Engineer, Renewable Energy Engineer and Bioengineer were accredited by the Inter-institutional Committees for the Evaluation of Higher Education (CIEES).</span>
              </p>

               <p>
                 <span>During the recent management from 2017 until now, the current administration worked on the construction of a Quality Management System (QMS) where they proposed a way of working based on processes and sub-processes, establishing assistants in educational programs to support the RPE work, in order to improve their development. Leading auditors were prepared under the ISO 9001: 2015 standard, laying the foundations for the school under a regulatory framework of quality management.</span>
              </p>    
               <p>
                 <span>Working with young people from previous levels was an activity with great impact. The linking area with previous levels was created with the development of STEAM activities focused on students from preschool to high school seeking to create vocations for engineering area. These actions contributed to the skills for the 21st century development. It was aimed to the integral development of students and clubs that were held. There, young people could develop artistic and technological activities to improve soft skills in a pleasant and cordial environment with their peers. Another aspect to highlight was the realization of sports tournaments like: soccer and basketball, allowing students to carry out multiple benefits from sports activities.</span>

                <h1 class="display-6 text-gradient-blueochre history-years"> <span class="spanyear-trasnparent">2019 year to onwards</span></h1> 
              <p>
                 <span>Ten educational programs were restructured, updating them on the needs of the environment. English I and II learning units were added to the Basic Core and courses were given in English. In 2019, ten educational programs of the school received international accreditation, by the Council for the Accreditation of Engineering Education (CACEI), A.C., which belongs to the Washington Accord. The accredited programs are: Computer, Electrical, Electronic, Mechanical, Civil, Industrial, Mechatronics, Bioengineer, Aerospace and Renewable Energy Engineer. Furthermore, this administration managed to maintain the graduate program at the PNC in conjunction with the other academic units belonging to MyDCI.</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>It was possible to position the FIM with the recognition by the National Association of Engineering Faculties and Schools (ANFEI) as one of the best engineering institutions of Mexico in 2019. This recognition was received under category B, that assemble Institutions, Faculties and Schools of Engineering in the education of engineers in Mexico.</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>Among the linkage actions, work was carried out on the association committees in function. A Collaboration agreement was established with the ¨Benemérita Escuela Normal Educadora Rosaura Zapata (BENERZ) to develop an inter-institutional research project. In addition, the dual model of education was established where students from the educational programs of Industrial Engineer, Electronics Engineer and Graduates in Computer Systems participate.</span>
              </p>    
              <p>
                 <span>In compliance with institutional commitments, the FIM sets precedents by establishing the project <bold>"Support program for environmental and social sustainability"</bold> with academic researchers and students work of the PE: Renewable Energies, who help vulnerable groups through saving and use energy efficiently and water conservation. Success stories were obtained with institutions such as CAHOVA, CAVIM, La Casita, among others. The researchers in charge are Dr. Alejandro Suástegui, Dr. Alexis Acuña and Dra. Marlene Zamora.</span>
              </p> 
              <p>
                 <span>In terms of infrastructure, some works were carried out such as: the replacement of the air conditioning system of the central building of the school, the change of the air conditioning system of buildings like Computer Engineering and Electronics Engineers. As well as the expansion of the Civil Engineering Laboratory building that will meet students’ needs in certain areas of knowledge. The most recent was the investment in communication infrastructure (internet) in all the central building rooms and laboratories.</span>
              </p>  
               <p>
                 <span>In the pursuit of an agile and effective management, for first time the management commits to the development of managerial skills in staff, training six FIM officials getting the senior management diploma for managers of engineering training institutions.</span>
              </p> 
              <p>
                 <span>Lastly, as an administration at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, we responded to the university community and to society when supplies were scarce, by manufacturing protective masks which were delivered to local medical units.</span>
